i want to add levels easy , medium and hard levels (buttons) based on no of coins collected. so before the time countdown starts a game levels menu has to be displayed showing easy medium and hard buttons so that if player clicks on "easy"   button then then countdown should start and then actual game where the sprite is running should be visible and  if player collects 10 coins then he wins 1st level and a "won " message should pop up along with the scores(already present in my code) and again the menu should be visible , now the player can click "medium " button and if player collects 20 coins then he wins 2nd level  and a "won message " should pop up  along with the scores(already present in my code) and again the menu should be visible and  now the player can click "hard " button and if player collects 30 coins then he wins 3rd level  and a "won message " should pop up  along with the scores(already present in my code) .please generate for me a easy step by step guide by generating lines of code and also tell where exactly in my current code i should paste the lines of code generated by you. i dont want to change my exisiting lines of current code instead generated new/additional lines of code for me so that after i paste them in my current code my requirements are met
